# Console Password Manager
A offline open-source password manager that runs in a console window.

Make one safe password, and save yourself the time and headaches trying to remember your passwords.

The program encrypts all your login information and saves it on your computer. The master password gets hashed so nobody can decrypt it and get access to all your accounts.

The data stored gets encrypted using multiple functions, and the key to the decryptor is your password, which nobody exept you should know.

Because the program is offline your passwords cannot be opened remotely. If you still feel unsafe, please read the code.

If you manage to break in and get information from the program, report it immediately so we can fix it as soon as possible.



### How to make a good password
Need help making a secure master password? Or just want to make a good password to use? After all, using a password manager allows a hacker to get all your passwords from a single password.
Here's how you can do it:
1. Take a long word or a sentence that you can remember, I'm  going to use Spaghetti Bolognese as example
2. Misspell it, kind of like this: Schpaggeti Blognes
3. Come up with a way to alter the word, or use one of the functions in the program. I'm using the Next Character method, so it looks like this: Tdiqbhhfuj Cmphft
4. Take a new way to alter the word, I'm going to make every third character the index it has in the alphabet, so it looks like this: Td9qb8hf21j C13ph6t
5. Add a new way to encrypt the word, I'm going to make every h a #, every 1 a ! and all the q's with <|, feel free to add more. It looks like this: Td9<|b8#f2!j C!3p#6t
6. To top it all of, I usually reverse the order. The example turned out like this: t6#p3!C j!2f#8b|<9dT

#### If you managed to complete all the steps, Congratulations! You have just created a very secure password. 
Feel free to add more steps to your password, the more the better but also more complicated.

If you don't want to use a password manager you should take a number of letters from the app name. Encrypt these letters the same way as the password, and add them to the password to make a unique password for every app.

Lets say I want 4 letters and create a github account using the example password. The base looks like this: Gith.The first step looks like this: Hjui. The second like this: Hj21i. The last two like this: #j2!i, i!2j#. I'm jus adding them to the end, so the complete password looks like this: Td9<|b8#f2!j C!3p#6t i!2j#
